<p>The Vegas Golden Knights have made 54 selections in eight NHL entry drafts as of 2024. An American professional ice hockey franchise located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the Golden Knights were founded ahead of the 2017–18 season as an expansion team, and play in the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL). The Golden Knights first participated in the 2017 NHL entry draft, in which they made Cody Glass their first-ever selection at sixth overall; they also selected Nick Suzuki and Erik Brannstrom later in the first round. Nicolas Hague (pictured), their 2017 second-round selection, has played the most games for the Golden Knights of any draft pick, with 296 games played as of the conclusion of the 2023–24 NHL season</p>
